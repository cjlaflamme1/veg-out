 ## Description <a href="description"></a>

Broaden your veggies horizons with the Vedge-In Challenge! Vedge-In is an application designed to help users eat healthier by encouraging them to increase the amount and diversity of vegetables in their diet. Log your veggie intake, challenge your friends, and watch you and your community get stronger and healthier! 

Having a whole foods, plant-based diet is key to living a long and healthy life. Eating a diverse array of vegetables gives you a nutrient-rich diet and promotes positive gut health. Eating a largely plant-based diet also lowers your chances of preventable illness. 

To begin, log into your account and start a challenge on the Challenges page. You can search for a friend, family member, or choose randomly from the Vedge-In community. Each challenge will last for one week. During this period, log each of the vegetables or fruit in your meals in the app. To check your status, navigate to the home page to review your stats and see your current score on the challenges page. 

How is the winner chosen? At the end of the week-long challenge period the final points will be calculated and compared. Scoring is based on: Unique Veggies/Fruits Each unique plant will be worth 10 points. Total Veggies/Fruits Each plant will be worth 1 point each time logged, with a maximum of 3 points per plant. This is to help promote diversity in your diet! Consistency Bonus Multiplier Did you have at least 3 plants for 12 or more meals? Thats a 3X bonus. 5 plants? 5X. 7 plants?!? That's right, 7X bonus. Now get out there and eat some plants!!!
