 ## Description <a href="description"></a>

 Vegemon is an application designed to help users eat healthier by encouraging them to increase the amount and diversity of vegetables in their diet.

When a user creates an account, they choose a playable character. The character starts with a base levels of the following stats: Health, Defense, and Offense. As the use goes through their day, they log the vegetables that they eat at each meal. The characters' stats are increased for each vegetable that is logged, with the type of stat being corellated to the actual benefits of the vegetable itself. 

Users can choose to set time-based challenges with eachother, and at the end of the alotted time whichever character has the best stats wins. 

Users are presented with information about the health benefits of the foods they are eating as they are inputted, and have access to a log of all inputted items.
